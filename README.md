# Analyzing Industry Trends in Finance, Insurance, Real Estate, and Rentals: A 2017 Dataset

## Project Motivation

This project explores the economic landscape of two key U.S. industries during 2017:  
- Finance and Insurance  
- Real Estate and Rental and Leasing  

Using employment, establishment, and payroll data aggregated by state, this analysis provides insights for policymakers, investors, and economists to understand regional economic strengths and trends.

## Libraries and Tools Used

- pandas  
- numpy  
- matplotlib  
- seaborn

## Files in the Repository

- `Finance.csv` — Dataset file containing 2017 financial and real estate industry data  
- `Finance_RealEstate_2017_Analysis.ipynb` — Jupyter Notebook with full data analysis, visualizations, and explanations  
- `README.md` — This file, including project overview and instructions

## Summary of Results

- California, New York, and Texas lead in employment and payroll in both industries.  
- Finance and insurance sector generally employs more workers than real estate, though both show wide regional variability.  
- Payroll data follows similar patterns, indicating economic output concentration in leading states.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository.  
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook `Finance_RealEstate_2017_Analysis.ipynb`.  
3. Ensure that the required libraries (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn) are installed — use `pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn` if needed.  
4. Run all cells sequentially to reproduce analysis and visualizations.
